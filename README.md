### Link for Hosted Website: [is here](https://spsrss-wp.000webhostapp.com/)

Billions of people have their bank accounts in several banks, but not everyone has access to the internet or have knowledge of performing transactions online. They still rely on going to banks physically to carry out transactions and banks help them in performing the transactions on their behalf. Our project aims to do that only.  
Our topic is Basic Banking System which is based on server side scripting and is managed by bank employees/admins only. They can carry out certain tasks requested by bank account holder after physically reaching the bank. 
### Scope
The specific options that we will be provided in our application are:
- Create new Account
- Delete an existing account
- Transfer money to some other account holder
-	View history of transactions  

All these operations will be done by the staff on behalf of the bank account holders.

### Requirements
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- Bootstrap
- VS Code
- XAMPP Control Panel
